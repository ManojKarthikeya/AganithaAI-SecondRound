				Sausage Man is a battle royale game, stylized to the likenings
				of PUBG and Fortnite. The only difference? Well, rather than
				embodying humans, this time you're in control of a sausage.
			</p>
			<p>
				Control systems in Sausage Man are complex. Not unlike any other
				kind of battle royale style game. Thankfully, they're also
				well-adapted to touchscreens. Towards your left, you'll find a
				movement crosspad and access to your stock of items. Whist on
				your right, you'll find buttons designed to help you crouch,
				jump, pick up cars, open doors, point, recharge and of course
				shoot.

            What makes Sausage Man a flagship project under Xdâ€™s long-term-focused strategy?
            </p>
            <p>
            We are now offering operation services to more nascent games, helping them and their developers grow. We are proud of who we are, what we do, and how we contribute.
